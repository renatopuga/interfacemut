Evaluation of the incidence, clinical relevance and prognosis of molecular mutations in patients with AML, Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
In the triennium 2012-2014, the project conducted at the Israelita Albert Einstein Hospital in partnership with the Program for Support to Institutional Development of the Unified Health System (PROADI-SUS): "Evaluation of the incidence, clinical relevance and prognosis of molecular mutations in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms and Viability Assessment of Two Consolidation Strategies in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia "sought to provide molecular and genetic testing for SUS patients with myeloid leukemias and performed the exome sequencing of these patients to seek new genetic changes.
